<p>Programa Preliminar da IYPT 2012 ( fonte,&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;iypt.wordpress.com&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;02&#47;25-iypt-2012-tasks&#47;" target="_blank">IYPT Germany<&#47;a>:&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;iypt.wordpress.com&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;02&#47;25-iypt-2012-tasks&#47;">http:&#47;&#47;iypt.wordpress.com&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;02&#47;25-iypt-2012-tasks&#47;<&#47;a>)</p>

<p><strong>1. Gaussian cannon:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;A chain of identical steel balls and a strong magnet (somewhere<br />
in the chain) are lying in a nonmagnetic channel. A further steel ball rolls slowly<br />
towards the chain and collides. The last outgoing ball in the chain is shot away<br />
faster, than you would imagine. Optimize the magnet&rsquo;s position for the largest<br />
effect.</p>
<p><strong>2. Cutting through the air:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;When a piece of thread (e.g., nylon) with a light mass<br />
attached at its end is whirled in the air, a distinct noise is emitted. Study the<br />
origin of this noise and relevant parameters.</p>
<p><strong>3. Chain of beads:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;A long chain of beads is released from a beaker<br />
by pulling a sufficient long part of the chain over the edge of<br />
the beaker. Due to gravity the speed of the chain increases. At a<br />
certain moment the chain does not touch the edge of the beaker<br />
any more (see picture). Investigate and explain the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fluid bridge:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;If high voltage is applied to a fluid (e.g. water) in two beakers, which<br />
are in contact, a fluid bridge can be formed. Investigate the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>5. Bright waves:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Illuminate a water tank. When there are waves on the water surface,<br />
you can see bright-dark patterns on the bottom of the tank. Study the relation<br />
between the waves and the pattern.</p>
<p><strong>6. Woodpecker toy:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;A woodpecker toy (see picture) exhibits an oscillatory<br />
motion. Investigate and explain the motion of the toy.</p>
<p><strong>7. Drawing pins:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;A drawing pin floating on the surface of water near a similar floating<br />
object is subject to an attractive force. Investigate and explain the phenomenon.<br />
Is it possible to achieve a repulsive force as well?</p>
<p><strong>8. Bubbles:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Is it possible to float on water, when there are large amounts of bubbles?<br />
Study how the floating of the body depends on the bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>9. Magnet and coin:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Put a coin vertically on a magnet. Incline the<br />
coin and then release it. The coin may fall down onto the magnet<br />
or reconvert to its vertical position. Study and explain the<br />
coin&rsquo;s motion.</p>
<p><strong>10. Rocking bottle:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Fill a water bottle with some liquid. Lay it down on a horizontal<br />
plane and give it a kick. The bottle may move forward and then oscillate before<br />
it comes to a full stop. Investigate the motion of the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>11. Flat flow:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Fill a thin gap between two large transparent horizontal parallel plates<br />
with a liquid and make a little hole in the centre of one of the plates. Investigate<br />
the flow in such a cell, if a different liquid is injected through the hole.</p>
<p><strong>12. Lanterns:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Paper lanterns float using a candle. Design and make a lantern using<br />
a single tea-light to take the shortest possible time (from lighting the candle)<br />
to float up a vertical height of 2.5m. Investigate the influence of the various<br />
parameters.</p>
<p><strong>13. Misty glass:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;Blow on a cold glass with your mouth so that water mist condenses<br />
on the glass surface. Look at a white lamp through the misty glass, you can see<br />
dim colourful rings appear outside the central fuzzy white spot. Explain the<br />
phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>14. Granular jets:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;When a marble or ball bearing is dropped onto a bed of fine, loose<br />
sand there will be a broad splash of sand at impact and, after the marble has<br />
penetrated deeply into the bed, a tall jet of granular material that shoots up<br />
vertically. How are these jets formed and what keeps them so collimated?</p>
<p><strong>15. Frustrating golf ball:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;It often happens that a ball (e.g. a golf ball) escapes from a<br />
cylindrical hole an instant after it has been putted in. Explain this phenomenon<br />
and investigate the conditions under which it can be observed.</p>
<p><strong>16. Rising bubble:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;A vertical tube is filled with a viscous fluid. On the bottom of the<br />
tube, there is a large air bubble. Study the bubble rising from the bottom to the<br />
surface.</p>
<p><strong>17. Ball in foam:<&#47;strong>&nbsp;A small, light ball is placed inside soap foam. The size of the ball<br />
should be comparable to the size of the foam bubbles. Investigate the ball&rsquo;s motion<br />
as a function of the relevant parameters.</p>
